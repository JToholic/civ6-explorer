Simple website to explore CIV 6 game elements on a world map, with real (or alleged) locations and photos (if they exist). 

WiP: Any comment or suggestion is more than welcomed!

## Dev note 2026-01-30
Code base and UI: no improvement planned

Content: Working **SLOWLY** on wonders. Natural wonders, leaders, city-states are planned with testers in place. 

Unlikely: Great people. There are too many of them.
